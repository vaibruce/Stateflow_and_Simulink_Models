# Stateflow_and_Simulink_Models

This repository contains a collection of Simulink and Stateflow models aimed at helping users learn and enhance their MATLAB skills, with a focus on system modeling, control design, and logic simulation. Suitable for both beginners and advanced users, these examples provide hands-on experience with MATLAB's powerful modeling tools.

## Contents

- **Basic Simulink Models**: Introductory models to familiarize with Simulink’s blocks and simulation capabilities.
- **Control System Examples**: Models of various control systems (e.g., PID control) for learning control design and tuning.
- **Stateflow Models**: Examples of state machines and event-driven systems to demonstrate Stateflow’s complex logic capabilities.
- **Hybrid Models**: Models that combine Simulink and Stateflow for applications needing both continuous dynamics and state-based logic.

Each model is crafted with a specific learning objective, covering a variety of real-world applications in engineering and control systems.

## Usage

Each model folder includes:
- **Model File** (`.slx` or `.mdl`): Open directly in MATLAB Simulink.
- **Description** (`README.md`): Briefly explains the model’s purpose.
- **Parameter Script** (where applicable): Allows you to modify model parameters.

To explore, simply open the models in Simulink, run simulations, and experiment with parameters to observe the effects.

## Learning Objectives

- Hands-on experience with Simulink for system modeling.
- Fundamental control systems concepts.
- State-based logic modeling with Stateflow.
- Hybrid application modeling with Simulink and Stateflow.
